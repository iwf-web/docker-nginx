# IWF Nginx Docker Base Image

## Overview

This is a Docker base image for an Nginx webserver communicating with a PHP-FPM server running in a separate
container.

It's a vital part of the IWF application stack.

This image contains configurations for Symfony4/5 and CraftCMS.

It should be used together with our [PHP base image](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/iwfwebsolutions/phpfpm).


## Links

The image is built weekly based on the official image `nginx:1.24-alpine` and `nginxinc/nginx-unprivileged:1.24-alpine` for the unprivileged build.

It's available here: https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/iwfwebsolutions/nginx

You should always use the tag: `iwfwebsolutions/nginx:1.24-latest`

## Versions

The X part of the version number `1.24-X` is always increased when we update the image configuration (e.g. config files).

It is NOT an indication to the patch level of the base image. It's **always** the **latest** nginx image of the supplied version,
currently only `1.24`.

See the CHANGELOG to find out the details.

## Usage / Environment variables

At the moment this image can be configured with all the configurations in the folder: `build/assets/data/conf/nginx/framework-configs`

The configuration can be chosen with the environment variable `APP_FRAMEWORK`.

Currently you have 3 options:

| Environment variable | default value | Description                                                                                                                                                                      |
|----------------------|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| APP_FRAMEWORK        | symfony       | The configuration file to link:`symfony` for Symfony 3 (app.php in `web`).`symfony4` for Symfony 4/5 (index.php in `public`).`craftcms` or `craftcms-nocache` for CraftCMS 3/4, |
| RUNTIME_ENVIRONMENT  | local         | Needed for scripts, currently only for `30_adjust_robots-txt.sh` (see below). Options:`<br>local`, `dev`, `qa`, `prod`                                                           |
| DOCUMENT_ROOT        | /app/web      | Directory where the webserver expects your static files to be mounted or copied into                                                                                             |
| WAIT_FOR             | fpm:9000      | The webserver waits for the FPM container to be started and answer network calls on Port 9000. Disable with an empty string.                                                     |
| UPSTREAM_HOST        | fpm:9000      | The upstream host:port for nginx as proxy (nginx `server` directive)                                                                                                             |
| ACCESS_LOG           | off           | Enable the access log by specifying a path to the access log file (inside the container), you normally should use `/var/log/nginx/access.log`                                    |


## Default startup scripts

All the scripts in the container's `/data/dockerinit.d` folder are run on each startup:

| Script                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                             |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 00_create_self-signed-cert.sh | Creates a self-signed certificate for the webserver if no certificate exists in /data/conf/nginx/certificates                                                                           |
| 00_enable_site.sh             | Copies and resolves `UPSTREAM_SERVER` with the `APP_FRAMEWORK`.conf file from `nginx/framework-configs` to `nginx/sites.d` where it's picked up by the default `nginx.conf`             |
| 00_wait-for-deps.sh           | Waits for the `WAIT_FOR` server -- by default for the PHP FPM server                                                                                                                    |
| 30_adjust_robots-txt.sh       | Creates a "Disallow all" robots.txt file for all environments (defined by `RUNTIME_ENVIRONMENT`) NOT being `local` and `prod`. This prevents search engines to index your DEV/QA sites. |

## Extension points (change or extend configuration)

You can insert your own configuration at these points. Just mount your own config files into these directories or create a derived image from this one and change the files as needed.

| Folder                              | Description                                                                                                                                  |
|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| /data/conf/nginx/http-partials.d    | `.conf` files here are included by the framework configs at the http (global) level                                                          |
| /data/conf/nginx/server-partials.d  | `.conf` files here are included by the framework configs at the server level                                                                 |
| /data/conf/nginx/security-headers.d | `.conf` files here are included by the server and location configs to extend or override the applied [security headers](security-headers.md) |
| /data/conf/nginx/certificates       | You should mount this directory to a folder on your host system. See the SSL section for further details.                                    |

## Permissions

The unprivileged image runs as user "nginx" (uid 101).

All the things you do atop this base image must respect this. If you copy additional files with the COPY directive,
you have to use it like this: "COPY --chown=nginx ..."

## SSL support

You can store your own SSL certificates in the folder `/data/conf/nginx/certificates`. The files should be named `cert.pem` and `key.pem`.
If you don't supply your own files, this image will automatically generate a self signed SSL certificate inside this folder. 
The diffie hellman parameter file (`dhparam.pem`) will be also created and stored in this folder if it doesn't exist.

## Framework specific

### Symfony 4

### Craft CMS

The nginx config file (`docker/build/assets/data/conf/nginx/framework-configs/craftcms-blitz.conf`) is used for Blitz Cache Plugin configuration.
Cached files are located in `/app/web/cache` directory.
